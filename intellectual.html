This purpose would draw people in on respecting each element and creating morales that lead people to one common goal which was to be reward in the afterlife. Each man woman or child had a set of respecting the world for example agriculture was a big start in our religion alike the Egyptians our rivers guided us into having a prosperous civilization. The river near us lead us with our hero myths and helped me with the flood myth. Alike feudalism Religious Leaders in the government stand with the government in war or revolution.
