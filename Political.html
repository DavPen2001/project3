    Political
    </h1>
    <p>
 Our government or political party is a democratic republic meaning that people don't directly vote for laws they vote for representatives who then vote on laws and other matters. We have a sort of legalism to keep everyone in balance, basically saying no one is above the law, and if anyone attempts to break these laws there will be serious and swift punishments. Who gets to be a citizen? Well we want anyone and everyone to be a citizen. All people deserve to be a citizen and we have a strict set of rules and laws that dictate who can be a citizen. Anyone who has lived in Joshland is eligible to acquire citizenship as long as they have lived in the region for at least 2 years, have no known criminal background, have a basic knowledge of our religion, davism, and contribute to our society's economy; i.e. taxes, and trade... All citizens have the right or better said the obligation to vote on pressing matters in the community. One laws states; “thou who kills shall suffer the same consequence” This law shows the fairness of our judicial system and how we value fairness. If someone kills someone we see the only punishment fit is death itself. This law reflects in our government because we value honesty, loyalty, and most of all fairness .Our government has very similar ties to legalism where every action has an equal and opposite reaction where if any rules are broken punishment will be swift and brutal.  Our people have the moral responsibility to help our community prosper in any way possible, whether that is votes for the next representatives or volunteering for our policing squad. People’s voices can be heard at weekly council meetings held at the center square where several representatives will hear out any people with questions or suggestions.
