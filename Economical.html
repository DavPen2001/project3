    <h1>
    Economical
    </h1>
    <p>
 In our civilization, in order for our people to have a successful life and lead them successfully, rules had to be set out. People had to fish most of the time, since that was our main food source. Also, people would had to collect a lot of sand due to our population growing. The sand would be turned into sandstone and glass. The sandstone was used for housing and other things. The glass is the same as the sandstone. While our civilization was growing, we had to make sure our society was all under control. Money was used for food, clothes, equipment, utilities, house products, and many other things. While purchasing all these things, you could also trade with other people. Trading is done with anyone in the civilization in the trading market. You could trade anything other than anything that is harmful, dangerous, and illegal. While trading, there will be some guards spectating the trading for no illegal trading done. Trading was all free, unless you're trading with someone that involves money. Puting the trading aside, tax was involved in a lot of things. Tax money was sent straight to the government and the army. We put taxes on most of the purchasable items/things. Also, every month, people are supposed to pay 3% of their total makings in that month to the tax service. The only technologies we had was, roofing, arrogation, and agriculture, papirays. We trade apples with the egyptians for us to make money.
